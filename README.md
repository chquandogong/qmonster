# Qmonster

Observe-first TUI for multi-CLI tmux development — watches Claude Code /
Codex / Gemini panes (plus itself), surfaces alerts, token-pressure
metrics, runtime facts, and recommendations. It does not touch observed
panes automatically; the operator can press `u` to cycle read-only
provider runtime slash commands on the selected pane.

- Version: v0.4.0 project phase. Runtime version is sourced from `git describe --tags --always --dirty` via `build.rs` and surfaced in the TUI footer (latest tag in this workspace: `v1.16.37`; current canonical ledger: `v1.16.37`). `Cargo.toml`'s `0.1.0` is not the operator-facing version.
- Target env: Ubuntu + tmux + Rust 1.85+
- Name origin: Dr. QUAN's Q + monitoring / master

## Why

Running Claude main, Codex review, and Gemini research side-by-side in
tmux is powerful but hard to babysit: you lose track of which pane is
waiting for approval, which one is bleeding tokens, and which alerted a
security concern two minutes ago.

Qmonster sits in its own tmux pane, polls the others, and shows the
operator-facing signals a human can't keep up with on their own. Its
three guiding principles are:

1. **Observe-first.** Read state before offering any action.
2. **Alert-first.** The loudest surface is the queue of things that
   need attention.
3. **Recommendation-first.** Qmonster recommends; humans (or explicit
   approval gates) act. **No destructive automation by default.**

See `docs/ai/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for the full statement of intent.

Recent post-Phase-4 TUI follow-ups are already shipped in-tree:
scrollable alerts/panes/help/target picker, mouse interaction, severity
bulk hide, session/window filtering, and a bottom-right version badge
that opens a Git status overlay. The Slice 4 `state` row appears on
each pane card when the pane is halted, with glyph + cause label +
elapsed time (`⏹ IDLE (done)` / `⏸ WAIT (input)` / `⚠ WAIT (approval)`
/ `⛔ USAGE LIMIT` / `⏸ IDLE (?)` for the stillness fallback). State
transitions now add a short `CHANGED` pulse on the pane header and
`state` row; a return to active briefly renders `▶ ACTIVE` before the
row disappears again. If the changed pane is selected, the selection
marker expands to `◆ CHANGED ◆` on every selected line and the card
header starts with `STATE CHANGED` during the flash.
The Phase-B visibility slice adds a `cmd` row sourced from tmux
`pane_current_command` on pane cards/detail/`--once`, plus selected-pane
Codex input/output token breakdown when the bottom status line exposes
ProviderOfficial `in`/`out` counts. The security posture slice keeps
YOLO / bypass / no-sandbox facts badge-only by default; set
`[security] posture_advisories = true` to promote them into passive
Concern recommendations.
Concurrent-work warnings are also quieter after v1.15.23: same path
alone is no longer enough; panes must expose the same git branch too.
The selected alert's `run:` command is copyable with `y` when Alerts are
focused; clipboard failure or a no-command selection is reported as a
visible system notice. The `c` key is reserved for system-notice clear.
Phase C has started: v1.16.0 extracts dashboard focus, selection, and
list hit-test helpers from `src/main.rs` into `src/app/keymap.rs`;
v1.16.1 moves the session/window target picker model, preview, and
choice logic into `src/app/target_picker.rs`; v1.16.2 moves provider
runtime-refresh command selection, cycling, send/capture, and notice
label helpers into `src/app/runtime_refresh.rs`; v1.16.3 moves alert
selection/hide/double-click and pane-state flash synchronization into
`src/app/dashboard_state.rs`; v1.16.6 moves shared git/help scroll modal
open/close/scroll state and key/mouse handlers into
`src/app/modal_state.rs`; v1.16.7 moves settings overlay key and mouse
dispatch into `src/app/settings_overlay.rs`; v1.16.8 moves operator
version-refresh and snapshot-write helpers into
`src/app/operator_actions.rs`; v1.16.9 moves `--once` report formatting
into `src/app/once_report.rs`; v1.16.10 moves prompt-send accept/dismiss
handling into `src/app/prompt_send_actions.rs`; v1.16.11 moves
runtime-refresh action orchestration into `src/app/runtime_refresh.rs`;
v1.16.12 moves selected-alert command copy notices into
`src/app/clipboard_actions.rs`; v1.16.13 moves target-picker
open/key/mouse dispatch into `src/app/target_picker.rs`; v1.16.14
moves dashboard Alerts/Panes selection key dispatch into
`src/app/dashboard_state.rs`; v1.16.15 moves dashboard mouse dispatch
into `src/app/dashboard_state.rs`; v1.16.16 moves default config-path
resolution into `src/app/path_resolution.rs`; v1.16.17 moves initial target
selection into `src/app/target_picker.rs`; v1.16.18 moves dashboard
frame/overlay render composition into `src/app/dashboard_render.rs`;
v1.16.19 moves terminal raw-mode/alternate-screen/mouse-capture lifecycle
into `src/app/terminal_session.rs`; v1.16.20 moves poll tick
success/failure routing and pane-state flash updates into
`src/app/polling_tick.rs`; v1.16.21 moves dashboard notices/reports,
list-selection, and alert freshness resync bookkeeping into
`src/app/dashboard_runtime.rs`; v1.16.22 moves startup config/root,
audit sink, pricing, Claude settings, retention, and version snapshot
assembly into `src/app/startup.rs`; v1.16.23 moves target-picker runtime
state ownership into `src/app/target_picker.rs`; v1.16.24 moves the live
TUI event loop into `src/app/tui_loop.rs`, leaving `src/main.rs` as a
thin CLI/startup/`--once`/TUI-entry wrapper. This completes the
pre-control-mode C1 split target enough for C2 adapter work to begin.
v1.16.25 starts C2 with an opt-in `[tmux] source = "control_mode"`
transport that implements the existing `PaneSource` contract through one
tmux control-mode client; default config remains `source = "polling"`.
v1.16.26 hardens that opt-in path by reconnecting the control-mode
client once on transport lifecycle errors such as `%exit`, EOF, or
broken pipe while leaving command-level tmux errors unchanged. v1.16.27
extracts shared tmux command builders so polling and control-mode use
the same list/capture/send argument contracts. v1.16.28 adds a live
polling-vs-control-mode parity checker for the active tmux session.
v1.16.29 extends that checker with `--all-targets` to validate each
discovered tmux window separately. v1.16.30 extracts shared pane
snapshot hydration so polling and control-mode parse list-panes rows and
attach tails through the same helper. v1.16.31 extracts shared tmux
window-target parsing for current/available target queries. v1.16.32
adds repeated parity runs so the same control-mode client can be checked
across consecutive commands. v1.16.33 extracts the control-mode protocol
parser/quoting/error-classifier into `src/tmux/control_protocol.rs`.
v1.16.34 treats live title drift as a parity warning by default, with
`--strict-title` available when title equality must fail the check.
v1.16.35 adds scripted unit coverage for the control-mode reconnect
boundary so lifecycle errors retry once while command errors do not.
v1.16.36 extracts polling tmux CLI execution into
`src/tmux/polling_process.rs`, so the polling source has a single
stdout/stderr/error mapping boundary before any control-mode default
decision.
v1.16.37 generalizes poll-tick failure/recovery notices from `tmux polling`
to `tmux source` so an opt-in control-mode runtime is not mislabeled in
the alert queue.

# Smoke test (one iteration; prints pane reports, version snapshot,
# and writes to ~/.qmonster/)
cargo run -- --once

# Launch the TUI
cargo run --release
#   q / Esc  — quit
#   Tab      — switch focus between alerts and pane list
#   ↑ / ↓    — scroll the focused list
#   PgUp/PgDn, Home/End — faster list navigation
#   Enter/Space — toggle auto-hide on the selected alert
#   t        — choose target (session -> window)
#   Enter    — move to window list / confirm window selection
#   Left / Backspace — back to session list
#   ?        — open help / legend overlay
#   r        — re-capture CLI versions; drift appears as a warning alert
#   s        — write a runtime snapshot to ~/.qmonster/snapshots/
#   u        — cycle provider runtime slash sources for the selected pane
#   y        — copy the selected alert's run command when Alerts are focused
#   c        — clear system notices
#   p        — accept pending prompt-send proposal on the selected pane (P5-3
#               safer-actuation; audit: PromptSendAccepted → Completed/Failed,
#               or PromptSendBlocked on observe_only / auto-send-off)
#   d        — dismiss pending prompt-send proposal (audit: PromptSendRejected)
#   S        — open cost/context/quota settings overlay
#   Mouse    — wheel scroll, click select, double-click alert hide
#   Footer version badge — click bottom-right to open Git status

# Standard operator launch. Creates ~/.qmonster/config/qmonster.toml and
# ~/.qmonster/config/pricing.toml from templates when missing, then starts
# Qmonster with --config so the settings overlay can persist edits.

For a tmux layout matching Qmonster's pane-title convention, see
`tmux/qmonster.tmux.conf.example`. Runtime-consumed config keys are
documented in `config/qmonster.example.toml`; operator pricing rates
live in `~/.qmonster/config/pricing.toml` using
`config/pricing.example.toml` as the template.

## Architecture at a glance

```
tmux::RawPaneSnapshot
   ↓
domain::IdentityResolver              (provider + instance + role + IdentityConfidence)
   ↓
adapters::ProviderParser              (one per provider; no identity inference)
   ↓
domain::SignalSet                     (typed signals, each with SourceKind)
   ↓
policy::Engine                        (pure: signals → (Recommendation | RequestedEffect)[])
   ↓
app::EffectRunner                     (allow-list; `recommend_only` by default)
   ↓  ↘
ui::ViewModel           store::EventSink   (Phase 1: NoopSink / InMemorySink)
```

Non-negotiable boundaries:

- Identity resolution **before** provider dispatch.
- `policy/` performs no IO.
- Runtime writes stay inside `~/.qmonster/` (Phase 2 writes `qmonster.db`,
  `archive/YYYY-MM-DD/<pane>/*.log`, `snapshots/*.json`, and
  `versions.json` — never touches project-dir files).
- `audit.rs` writer cannot accept raw bytes — type-level separation.
  The SQLite schema has no raw_tail column; raw tails only live in
  `archive_fs.rs`.

See `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` for module responsibilities and the full
SourceKind taxonomy (`ProviderOfficial | ProjectCanonical | Heuristic |
Estimated`).

## Development

```bash
cargo test --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build
./scripts/check-tmux-source-parity.sh
./scripts/check-tmux-source-parity.sh --all-targets
./scripts/check-tmux-source-parity.sh --all-targets --repeat 3
mission-spec validate .
mission-spec eval --shared .
MISSION_SPEC_CLI=/abs/path/to/mission-spec.js ./scripts/verify-shared.sh
```

If `mission-spec` is not installed, `scripts/verify-shared.sh` still
runs cargo build/test/clippy and falls back to a lite ledger-structure
check with install guidance.

The event-loop integration tests use a fixture `PaneSource` so they do
not require a real tmux session.

## Status & scope

Qmonster is not a provider orchestrator, not a destructive automator,
and not a cloud service. It is a single-user, local-first operating
console. Default action mode is `recommend_only`; refresh policy is
`manual_only`; logging sensitivity is `balanced`. All four safety flags
can only move toward safer via env/CLI — attempted upward overrides
are rejected and audit-logged.
